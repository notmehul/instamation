stealing jobs of social media managers with LLMs ðŸ˜¼

Using the LLaVa 1.6 + Mistral 7B model and Selenium, and some string manipulation, this program is able to:
- Generate cool captions for a given image
- Suggest edits like Brightness, Contrast, Fade, etc
- Make those edits
- Login to your instagram and post it

Example of edits:
original image
<img src="https://github.com/notmehul/instamation/blob/main/ogimage.jpg" width="500" height="500">

edited:
<img src="https://github.com/notmehul/instamation/blob/main/edited-image.jpg" width="500" height="500">


Future Updates:
- Multi image support (selenium)
- Making the LLM select which image goes first. Multi image inputs are a problem as of now. (if this gets changed please feel free to ping me, even i would love to know)

Thanks ^_^
